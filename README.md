# Discord LLM Interaction Bot

A Discord bot that combines the capabilities of an LLM-based language model for text-based interactions and Replicate for image analysis. This bot is ideal for developers, educators, and anyone interested in exploring AI-based interactions within Discord.

## üåü Features

- **LLM AI Interaction**: Engage with an advanced language model to get text-based responses to queries or execute instructions.
- **Replicate Image Analysis**: Upload an image and get descriptive and insightful analysis based on machine learning models.
- **User Permissions**: Limit interactions to specific users or roles for controlled access.
- **Dynamic System Setting**: Set the system prompt for LLM queries dynamically using a slash command.
- **Python Code Execution**: Run Python code blocks securely when required.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging to monitor bot interactions and diagnose issues.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Environment Variables

[Refer to `.env.sample` for explanations and sample values.]

### Option a: Deploy to Render

You can deploy this project to Render by clicking the button below:

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/matthewhand/discord-llm-bot)
1. Click the \"Deploy to Render\" button.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to configure your Discord bot.
3. Once deployed, go to the service dashboard for further configuration and monitoring

### Option b: Deploy to localhost

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file at the root of your project and populate it with necessary environment variables.
4. Start the bot with `npm start`.

### Option c: Deploy to localhost - Docker

First, create a `.env` file at the root directory of your project. Copy and update the `.env.sample` as a starting point.

Build the Docker image:

````
docker build -t discord-llm-bot .
````

Run the Docker container:

````
docker run --env-file .env discord-llm-bot
````

This will load all the environment variables defined in your `.env` file into your Docker container.


## üõ† Usage

### Wakewords and Continued Conversation

The bot uses wakewords to initiate a conversation. Once a conversation is initiated, you can continue interacting with the bot without using the wakeword for a certain period of time.

To engage with the LLM, mention the trigger word along with your query or instruction.

The bot will respond with the output from the LLM backend you provide (see services/ folder for the options I use).

### Replicate Image Analysis

To analyze an image, simply upload it to the designated channel. The bot will send the image for analysis and return the results.

````
Upload an image to the channel along with a prompt prefixed with !analyse
e.g. !analyse what is the primary subject of this image?
````

The bot will provide analysis based on the machine learning model specified.

### Code Execution and AI Interaction

````
!execute

```python
print('Hello, world!')
```
````

## üìä Monitoring

The `/health` and `/uptime` endpoints return HTTP/200 for monitoring.

## Built with ChatGPT
